# Metropolis-Algorithm-for-rotor-lattice

These program were written in Cython. 

Two programs for sophisticated implementation of a model lattice with nearest neighbor interactions. DFT calcuations were performed by collaborator to explore the energetics of F2BODCA-MOF motion of a MOF crystal structure, and the resultant 2-fold symmetry in rotational lattice potential serves as one input to the Hamiltonian used in Monte Carlo simulation. This simulation was used along side experimental probes, including dielectric measruement and solid state NMR, in order to infer about phase transitions and the electronic grond state configuration of this rotor lattice. A visual simulation of the lattice is included in the program files.
