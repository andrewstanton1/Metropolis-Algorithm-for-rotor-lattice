# Metropolis-Algorithm-for-rotor-lattice

These program were written in Cython. The cy_metropolis program is an implementation of the Ising model.  https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ising_model

The other two program are a more sophisticated implementation of a model lattice with nearest neighbor interactions. DFT calcuations were perfored to explore the energetics of F2BODCA-MOF motion of a MOF crystal structure. This simulation was used along side experimental probes in order to infer about phase transitions and other physical properties of this rotor lattice. A visual simulation of the lattice is included in the program files.
